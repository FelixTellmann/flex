Lets have a look at how we can use typescript in our code and make use of TypeScripts powers to make
coding easier and more predictable. The simple yet powerful _main feature_ of TypeScript is to add
_type annotations_ to variables or functions.

Some of the valid TypeScript types are:

- `number`
- `string`
- `boolean`
- `Array`
- `enum`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `void`
- `tuple`
- `never`
- `any`

<CodeComponent
  maxWidth={"650px"}
  contentBlock={{
    title: `Let's explore each Type `,
    /*description: `One of our main goals is to provide the best possible
                  developer experience. Radix Primitives provides a fully-typed API. All components share a similar API, creating a consistent and predictable experience`,*/
  }}
  codeBlocks={[
    {
      caption: "Type `number`",
      description: `The number type can be used for integers, floats, bigint's, binary, hex and NaN`,
      code: `@import(./content/examples/ts-03-numbers.tsx)`,
    },
  ]}
/>
